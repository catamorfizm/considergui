ConsiderGUI
===========

This is a small helper program to manage your Considerater profiles
out of game.  It also allows you to run SimulationCraft to generate a
profile.

Installation
------------

For most users you should obtain the ZIP file with the binary EXE file
and just unpack it anywhere and run it.  It contains all the libraries
needed to run, and it will ask you for a couple of configuration
options at the start.

Compilation
-----------

If, for some reason, you want to compile your own copy, then here's
what you need to do:

* Install the Haskell Platform http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
  - Add the included "mingw\bin" folder to your PATH environment variable.
    e.g. C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2010.2.0.0\mingw\bin
* GTK+ (I used the all-in-one bundle v2.16) http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
  - Extract the bundle to a directory (like C:\GTK-2.16)
  - Add C:\GTK-2.16\BIN to your PATH environment variable.
* Open a command line (e.g. cmd.exe)
  - Run: cabal update
  - Run: cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
  - Run: cabal install gtk
* With the command line in the ConsiderGUI folder
  - Run: ghc --make Main -o ConsiderGUI
